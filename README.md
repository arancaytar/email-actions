# email-actions
email-actions is a tiny SMTP server with a rules based engine to trigger any actions (notifications/commands etc) based on the emails sent to this server.
Think of it like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) but where input trigger is email and can be set up and run locally as well.

# Why did you make email-actions
Like most of my projects, email-actions is a 'scratch-your-own-itch' project. I bought a NAS (Synology ds216j) which also doubled as a downloader of anime/tv shows etc through RSS using it's inbuilt "Download Station" app. I also used plex to watch them over the network but These needed to be moved to a proper folder and named in a specific format (and some crap deleted and other maintenance done or sometimes some post processing done) to have Plex display/play them properly. I used filebot and a few custom scripts for this but had to either do this manually or use a fixed time task scheduling. This was semi-useful. 
Download station had a way to run custom script after a download was completed but it was hacky (change internal files) and had to be redone after every firmware update. And finally it stopped working altogether. 

It did support email notifications though. Thus email-actions was born. So I could push notifications for downloaded items run my custom scripts on the downloaded items.

Since then, I've started using it for many other things as email is pervasive and most of the devices support email based notifications. So I can trap them and carry out other actions.

# What are the benefits/differences compared to hosted services like IFTTT
IFTTT provides email hooks as well. I *think* email-actions may be an alternative (you can decide whether it's better or not) with respect to below:
- Can be run locally with minimal dependencies. You don't need to send your data to internet or even have an internet connection
- Tiny footprint
- Can run local commands as well while IFTTT still needs to be integrated with something else if that's what you need
- You are in control of your info
- Free(er). That is no limitations on hooks/conditions etc
